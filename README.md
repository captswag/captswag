Hi there. Iâ€™m Anjith Sasindran. An android and web developer living and working in Bangalore. I love programming, gaming, reading about computers and Iâ€™m a bit of a gadget freak. I also can type pretty fast ðŸ¤·. I'm currently working at Grab and before which I was at BookMyShow. I play and watch football, enjoys working out and often times read books.
